# boring_chat

A testing ground for languages and frameworks using a standardized chat application.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to create a simple chat application that can be used to test out different languages and frameworks.

Since I am a web-developer, I examnine technology through a web-development lens. This project is meant to help facilitate that examination through building a simple chat application with the same specifications across different languages and frameworks.

## Frontend

The frontend app is a simple sveltekit application meant to be run locally on your machine with little to no config needed.
